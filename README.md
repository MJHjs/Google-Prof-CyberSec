# Google-Prof-CyberSec

Professional Statement Outline

Strengths I am committed to developing
(Blue Team, Basic Cloud Knowledge, Linux)

Current Values
(Protecting People and Organizations; hitting issues at the root level before they have a chance to begin)

Clarifying Questions
(We are never going away from tech or less tech in the future; which means more and more PII / SPII will be available
more points of failure; greater the need for CyberSec)

(Hoping to aim this square at CyberSec Recruiters; Specific Companies ATM are: DataDog / SalesForce / CrowdStrike / Red Canary / IBM / Artic Wolf / Palo Alto)

(Current Strength; switching from a background in Sales -- People and connecting; like sitting at the bar with Jameson in our cup; it's no different
adding the technical aspect will hopefully be the easiest part after dealing with people for so long

MY version of Social Engineering but not really)
