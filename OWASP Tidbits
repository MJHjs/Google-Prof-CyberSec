# OWASP security principles

- Minimize attack surface area: Attack surface refers to all the potential vulnerabilities a threat actor could exploit.

- Principle of least privilege: Users have the least amount of access required to perform their everyday tasks.

- Defense in depth: Organizations should have varying security controls that mitigate risks and threats.

- Separation of duties: Critical actions should rely on multiple people, each of whom follow the principle of least privilege. 

- Keep security simple: Avoid unnecessarily complicated solutions. Complexity makes security difficult. 

- Fix security issues correctly: When security incidents occur, identify the root cause, contain the impact, identify vulnerabilities, and conduct tests to ensure that remediation is successful.
